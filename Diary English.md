A learning diary of a freshman in stock trading.

Chapter 1: Introduction

I decided to start this diary on Jan 10, 2026, the day I return to university, because my schedule will be more stable and I will have more consistent time to study.

For convenience, I define the first period as Jan 1–Jan 10, 2026. Technically, it should be Jan 4–Jan 10, but I want to use Jan 1 as a symbolic start for both the new year and this learning session.

Chapter 2: Let’s Get Started

Period One (2026.1.1–2026.1.10) is mainly a preparation period. During this time, I will set up the materials and lessons for my first study session (roughly my first month).

My first main resource is Yale’s online course Financial Markets, taught by Prof. Robert J. Shiller. With the help of ChatGPT, I chose it as a starting point because, as a freshman in trading, I need a basic understanding of the overall financial market. I also prepare Reminiscences of a Stock Operator for reading.

I also plan to learn one strategy per week, then use paper trading for 1–2 weeks to test it and find what suits me best. I will start with easier strategies because I don’t have enough financial knowledge yet to fully understand complicated ones. I also want to limit the number of strategies at the beginning (around 20–30) to avoid learning too many at once.

For this first period, my basic plan is: spend about one week finishing Reminiscences of a Stock Operator and opening my first paper trading account. After that, I plan to use about four weeks to finish Financial Markets.

I won’t take detailed notes on GitHub. I will mainly use handwritten notes, then use AI to help organize them and publish the organized version here.
